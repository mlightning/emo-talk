Python REST Backend for Messaging app.
========

emo-talk is a typical messaging app for friends.
Users signup and send friend requests, they can accept or reject.
Once connected they can send/receive messages, this app is mostly about sending emoticons (we love them :) !)

API is built with Python and [Django REST framework](http://www.django-rest-framework.org/), uses Postgres for data storage.
